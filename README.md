# Moodscape
**Note:** 
This project is still in progress; our next steps are to allow images on the canvas to be dragged around freely, rather than having them just snap to the canvas. 

## About
Moodscape is an app that allows users to easily create moodboards, or, in other words, collages that are used to convey a certain feeling or aesthetic. Users can search for images using the Unsplash API, and can add their liked images to a canvas. Images on the canvas can be dragged around as needed.
